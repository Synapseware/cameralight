## About
The camera light is meant to be just that - a camera light.  But with a twist: It's meant to be an underwater lighting platform using a ring of white LEDs around the camera lens housing (which is probably a really bad idea in practice).  The module uses a LIPO battery, inductive charging and photo sensors to turn on and off.  It has very low power draw when "off" allowing it to stay in standby mode for quite a long time.  The only other "complex" part of the circuit is a boost-mode constant current LED driver, which is supposed to light up those LEDs enough to actually work underwater.  But who wants to go diving at night?
